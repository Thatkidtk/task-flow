# How This App Can Be Improved

A roadmap of enhancements to take TaskFlow from a polished local PWA to a production-grade, collaborative web app.

## Product & UX
- Recurring tasks, reminders, and snooze
- Tags, labels, and saved filters
- Calendar view (week/month) and iCal export
- Kanban board and drag‑and‑drop reordering
- Bulk actions and multi‑select
- In‑place editing for groups, members, and tasks
- Dark mode and theme customization
- Rich text in descriptions and checklists/subtasks

## Collaboration
- Multi‑user accounts with invitations and roles (owner/admin/member)
- Real‑time sync (WebSockets) and optimistic updates
- Comments, mentions, and activity notifications
- Email and push notifications (web push)

## Data & Integrations
- Cloud sync with a backend (e.g., Supabase/Firebase/Next.js API)
- OAuth sign‑in (Google/Microsoft/GitHub/Apple)
- Attachments via cloud storage (S3/GCS)
- Integrations: Slack/Teams, Google Calendar, Zapier/Make

## Reliability & Security
- Server‑side persistence and backups
- Proper auth (hashed passwords, sessions/JWT, CSRF)
- Role‑based access control and audit logs
- Input validation and sanitization front/back end

## Performance & Quality
- Split CSS/JS, code‑split UI; use a bundler (Vite)
- Lighthouse/Axe passes; deeper a11y (keyboard/ARIA/contrast)
- Unit tests for logic + e2e (Playwright/Cypress)
- Error tracking (Sentry) and analytics (privacy‑friendly)
- Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)

## Architecture (example)
- Frontend: React/Vue/Svelte + TypeScript
- State/query: TanStack Query/Redux/Signals
- Backend: Next.js or Node + Postgres (Prisma) or Firebase/Supabase
- Infra: Vercel/Netlify for FE, Fly/Render for BE; object storage for files
